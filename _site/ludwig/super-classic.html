<p>The Super Classic model was a standard configuration for the industry and preferred by many drummers. The dimensions of Super Classic outfits allow for versatile tuning ranges and tones complimenting anything from high tension jazz/bebop, to thumbing bold low/mids in rock/pop. The cost of the drum kit shown on the right was valued approximately $460 new (including hardware, but not cymbals) in the 1960s. Super Classic kit’s were available as a four piece configuration made from Ludwig’s innovative 3-ply shell mold with 5x14 supra-phonic snare.</p>
