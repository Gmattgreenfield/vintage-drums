<p>Vistalite drums were a line of acrylic PET (Polyethylene terephthalate) drums produced by the Ludwig Drum company,[1] introduced in 1972. The name Vistalite refers to the translucent plastic that the shells were made out of. Vistalite and acrylic offered a synthetic alternative to wood shells and were popularized by rock drummer John Bonham of Led Zeppelin.</p>
